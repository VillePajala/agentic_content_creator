Below is a detailed exploration of the key privacy and security concerns associated with AI systems similar to Mariner.

#### Privacy Concerns in AI Systems

1. **Informational Privacy Risks**  
   AI systems often collect, process, and store vast amounts of personal data. This raises concerns about 'informational privacy,' which involves protecting personal data from breaches and misuse ([Transcend.io](https://transcend.io/blog/ai-and-privacy)).

2. **Data Breaches and Unauthorized Access**  
   The potential for data breaches and unauthorized access to personal information is one of the main privacy concerns. High-profile incidents have already demonstrated the impact that such breaches can have on user trust and the reputation of AI systems and their developers ([Economic Times](https://m.economictimes.com/news/how-to/ai-and-privacy)).

3. **Lack of Transparency**  
   AI systems often operate as "black boxes," with decision-making processes that are opaque to users. This lack of transparency can lead to privacy violations when users are unsure of how their data is being processed and used ([Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-ethical-and-privacy-concerns-surrounding-AI)).

#### Security Concerns in AI Systems

1. **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Protections**  
   AI systems must secure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their data and processes. Failures in these areas can lead to significant breaches and loss of user trust ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-bias-security-privacy-charting)).

2. **Data Poisoning and Attacks**  
   AI systems are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious inputs are used to corrupt the data model of an AI system. These attacks can have a significant impact on the performance and reliability of AI applications ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2624-800X/3/2/10)).

3. **Privacy Attacks**  
   Specific types of attacks, such as data reconstruction, membership inference, model extraction, and property inference, pose current concerns for AI privacy. Organizations must be vigilant in protecting against these threats ([IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/privacy-attacks-on-ai-systems)).

#### Ethical and Broader Implications

1. **User Consent and Ethical Use**  
   Ensuring that AI systems like Mariner operate with explicit user consent and adhere to ethical guidelines is paramount for maintaining user trust. Organizations must prioritize developing transparent consent mechanisms and ethical standards for AI deployment ([Velaro](https://velaro.com/blog/the-privacy-paradox-of-ai-emerging-challenges-on-personal-data)).

2. **Trust and Adoption**  
   Addressing privacy and security concerns is crucial not only for protecting user data but also for promoting broader adoption of AI technologies. Public fears and skepticism about AI's privacy implications can significantly impede the deployment and success of these systems ([Transcend.io](https://transcend.io/blog/ai-and-privacy)).

In conclusion, while AI systems like Mariner promise immense technological advancements, their success hinges on effectively addressing privacy and security concerns.
