The research on the timeline of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) reveals a complex landscape of predictions and trends largely based on expert opinions, strategic scenario planning, and empirical data.

Anton Korinek's work on scenario planning explores different potential timelines for AGI reaching maturity. By considering aggressive, moderate, and conservative scenarios, Korinek highlights vast differences in economic outcomes associated with each timeline. His work emphasizes the importance of preparing for various possibilities, acknowledging that the exact timing of AGI's breakthrough remains uncertain.

Meanwhile, the work by "Our World in Data" reflects a diversity of expert opinions. The general consensus suggests a significant possibility of developing human-level AI within the next few decades, although opinions vary greatly depending on the study and methods used to gather expert views. This variation underlines the complexity and unpredictability inherent in forecasting technological advancements in AI.

The Stanford AI Index Report offers empirical insights into AI's current capabilities and growth trends. By examining the number and impact of AI models developed, as well as their performance across different domains, the report provides a data-driven perspective on the progress towards AGI. Continued improvements in AI technologies, infrastructure, and accessibility suggest a trajectory of steady advancement, although reaching general intelligence remains a formidable challenge.

Overall, the timeline for AGI is still a subject of active debate and research, with no consensus on the exact timing. The advancement trajectory depends on a myriad of factors including technological breakthroughs, ethical and regulatory frameworks, and global collaborative efforts. As AGI development progresses, integrating diverse expert perspectives and maintaining flexible strategic plans will be crucial in navigating the uncertain future of AI.
