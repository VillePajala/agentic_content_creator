The timeline of AGI involves examining its historical roots, the current state of technological advancements, contrasting expert predictions, and the prospective societal impacts it might entail. Historically, the journey towards AGI stems from the early ambitions of AI researchers in the 1950s and 1960s, with the term itself being coined in 2007. The current landscape is marked by substantial technological progress led predominantly by the private sector, highlighting both advancement and challenges such as computational resource demands. Predictions span a wide range, with some experts suggesting realization by the mid-2020s, while broader surveys propose a 50% chance by 2060. Roadblocks such as computational limits, ethics, and the understanding of human-like intelligence remain. Ultimately, the implications of AGI extend beyond technology into societal transformation, ethical frameworks, and altered global dynamics, necessitating careful and collaborative governance to ensure these systems align with human-centric values and maximize benefits.
